# *Stonk Market*

## High Concept
While keeping carful watch over the day's *Stonk* prices, the player has to buy low and sell high or go bankrupt.

## Genre
Simulation, Gambling, Joke, Casual

## Platform
"mobile-friendly"

## Story
The player is a trader of an abstract, fictional investment item called a *Stonk*, named for the popular "Stonks" meme. To define a *Stonk* would defeat the purpose of the joke, which is that they are abstract, meaningless, and operate on rules which are a gross oversimplification/perversion of actual stock trading.

## Aesthetics
..* Graphics - Simple and abstract. The only graphics are the graph, the red line that progresses across it, and clickable buttons with accompanying text.
..* Sound - The main theme song from popular game show *The Price is Right* plays in the background (but it is toggleable through a button). Some actions in the game are accompanied by jaring, annoying sound effects, like a "ka-ching" noise whenever they click the "Sell" button.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics
The player looks at a lined graph which has a y-axis of "$" and an x-axis of seconds. A red line proceeds across the graph horizontally at a constant rate, but has random vertical movements. This line graph tells them the price of *Stonks*, which are extremely volatile assets. The player can also see a text field which tells them the amount of $ they have and another which tells them how many *Stonks* they have. The player has access to a "Buy *Stonk*" button, which, when pressed, will increase the "*Stonks* Counter" by 1 and decrease the "$ Counter" by an amount corresponding to the current vertical posistion of the line. The player will also have a "Sell *Stonk*" button which does the exact opposite. Nothing will be done to prevent the line from moving drastically upwards (even if it leaves the bounds of the viewport). This is a funny and rewarding occurence for players, so it should be left as an "intended bug". The same is true of occasions where the graph moves drastically down so that *Stonks* have a negative value, which should reward players who can quickly process the logic of what it means to buy something with a negative value. When the line reaches the horizontal bound of the graph (which might take a little under a minute), the day will end and the player will be informed of how much $ they made or lost that day, with a button to proceed the next day, which can occur indefinitely.

### Control
The game will be controlled with just the mouse to click the on-screen buttons. If "mobile-friendly"-ness is achieved, then there will also be touch controls and the buttons will be larger.

### New User Experience
With a limited suite of labeled, visible buttons, the player should be able to figure out how to play on their own pretty quickly. All other breakthroughs in mechanical understanding will be part of the gameplay experience.

### Player Learning
It's surprising how many people confuse the axiom "buy low, sell high" into "buy high, sell low". Players will only be able to succeed if they clear this confusion and eliminate all doubt. More advanced strategy includes learning that the line is not actually contained by the vertical bounds that the graph would imply and is capable of going to drastic values. A player who understands this will be able to coordinate their spending to capitalize on these oppurtunities. Players who understand that they can press the "Buy" button when the value of *Stonks* becomes negative will be especially rewarded. These occasions can also save players who made many mistakes and lost too much money to buy *Stonks* at the average value.
