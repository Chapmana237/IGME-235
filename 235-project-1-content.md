# *Stonks*

### High Concept
While keeping carful watch over the day's *Stonk* prices, the player has to buy low and sell high or go bankrupt.

### Genre
Simulation, Gambling, Joke, Casual

### Platform
"mobile-friendly"

### Story
The player is a trader of an abstract, fictional investment item called a *Stonk*, named for the popular "Stonks" meme. To define a *Stonk* would defeat the purpose of the joke, which is that they are abstract, meaningless, and operate on rules which are a gross oversimplification/perversion of actual stock trading.

### Aesthetics
..* Graphics - Simple and abstract. The only graphics are the graph, the red line that progresses across it, and clickable buttons with accompanying text.
..* Sound - The main theme song from popular game show *The Price is Right* plays in the background (but it is toggleable through a button). Some actions in the game are accompanied by jaring, annoying sound effects, like a "ka-ching" noise whenever they click the "Sell" button.

### Gameplay
The player looks at a lined graph which has a y-axis of "$" and an x-axis of seconds. A red line proceeds across the graph horizontally at a constant rate, but has random vertical movements. This graph tells them the price of *Stonk*, which are extremely volatile assets. The player can also see a text field which tells them the amount of $ they have and another which tells them how many *Stonks* they have. The player has access to a "Buy *Stonk*" button, which, when pressed, will increase the "*Stonks* Counter" by 1 and decrease the "$ Counter" by an amount corresponding to the current vertical posistion of the bar graph. The player will also have a "Sell *Stonk*" button which does the exact opposite. Nothing will be done to prevent the graph from moving drastically upwards (even if it leaves the bounds of the viewport) This is a funny and rewarding occurence for players, so it should be left as an "intended bug". The same is true of occasions where the graph moves drastically down so that *Stonks* have a negative value.
